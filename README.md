# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning techniques on medical data. It aims to assist in early diagnosis by analyzing key health parameters.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset contains medical attributes such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and heart rate.

## Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Selection
4. Model Training
5. Model Evaluation

## Results
The trained model achieves good accuracy in predicting heart disease risk.
